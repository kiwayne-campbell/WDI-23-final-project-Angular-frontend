Methodology:

In terms of this being my final project, I wanted to push what I had learnt on my course at GA and try and code as much as possible from scratch.  This is a full stack app Solo Project which combines ruby backend and AngularJS front end.

# What was it like building the site

Firstly, for the front end, I tried to keep the design as minimal as possilbe & went for an aethestic that tried to mimic airbnb.  

Again, what I am learning & having great respect for is the design process & CSS skills.  I do not have a design background, so even looking at how something like airbnb is put together is incredible. I also found that once you use different fonts, this really can make a difference in the punch on a website.

# Challenges & fun

Some of the cool things I enjoyed figuring out was a search function that didn't use any ruby gems on the back end. Very easy to want to do this, but figured it would give em a challenge. 

It used a combination of using the param field of a search bar and inputting 

You can find this on my backend section here:


The only problem with this is it is limited.

I also need to look at integrating a search filter on the display page.


For fun I implemented a banner ad on the right hand side to fill some space- mostly a nod to my previous work in banner advertising and also, it is how most websites are design with content in 2/3rds on the left and the right hand space for additonal links or advertising.


# What would I like to implement in the future?

I will look at integrating an twitter api - so when people search for festivals and get to the final page which displays the festival information- people will see a twitter feed with that festivals news.

Overall tighter CSS design, which will take a but longer.
